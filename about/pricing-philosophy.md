# Pricing Philosophy

_Competing on prices is a race to the bottom._

We don't compete on price, and we won't be the cheapest, but we are not a luxury brand. We are high-quality goods for democratic people who appreciate good design.

Our products are not the cheapest, but they aren't out of reach for a young person or someone on a budget who understands the value of investing in quality and keeping that item for a long time. It's where brands like Warby Parker, the iPhone, or Patagonia thrive. You could think of this price range as "democratic quality." High-quality, and not the cheapest, but made to last and available to most people.

## Democratic Quality
Key to this positioning is the customer knowing that when you buy an iPhone it's the same iPhone a billionaire can buy. As Andy Warhol said:

"What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it."

We might often need to charge 20%-30% more than our competitors, but we are still attainable. And even if it takes some extra work or patience to buy our products, this process actually adds value because of the story you tell yourself when you buy our products.
