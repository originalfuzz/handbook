# 1% Pledge

_We pledge 1% of top-line revenue to causes that encourage people to realize their creative potential._

Our pledge was inspired by and adopted from Patagonia's 1% for the Planet pledge. Whether we turn a profit or lose money we still pledge the same amount and will donate 1% of our sales every month to a cause chosen by our team.

No matter how you slice it, this 1% always comes out to a much greater contribution than the traditional tithe of 10% of earnings. When contributing a percentage of your profits you have a lot of wiggle room to add expenses or pay yourself more and reduce your organization's commitment to giving.

We do not want to be yet another business whose only purpose is to enrich its shareholders. We want to enrich the lives of our customers, our employees, our partners, and the community in which we operate. This pledge is our commitment to that goal.
