# The Story We're telling

_What is the story we're telling?_

We tell the story of what it takes to do great work, original work—the obstacles that you have to overcome and what it looks like on the other side. How our creative heroes were just like us at some point. Our customers are the heroes in this story. They are the members of Joy Division at their first Sex Pistol’s show realizing that they could start a band too if those guys could do it.

Humans are story machines. Whenever we can successfully explain what we're doing or frame the message we're trying to communicate in the form of a story we'll do a better job of connecting with, and ultimately serving, the people we seek to reach.
