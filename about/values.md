# Our Values

Some things, like showing up to work on time or providing great customer service, are just table stakes that any business needs to be successful. A core value is never table stakes. It's the thing that we'd still do even it was more profitable to do the opposite. It's the thing that gives our brand a personality and gives our company its unique shape. If we had no sharp angles, we'd have nothing for anyone, customers or employees, to latch on to, to care about.

If we have to do business in a way that violates our values, then what's the point of having a business at all? We can all go pursue other things. If we're going to do this, we're going to have our own perspective. This is what we mean by values.

### The Difference Between Tactics and Values
An example of something that is not a core value is practicing lean manufacturing. This is definitely a best practice for modern manufacturing, and we work hard to carry as little inventory as possible, but if it suddenly became a better tactic to carry a ton of inventory we would do it. It's a tactic, not a core value. Our values are the things we won't change even if it hurts us, because, otherwise, why bother?

## Our Values

1. Make what we want to see in the world.
2. Champion the underdog.
3. Practice empathy.
4. Don't assume. Experiment.
5. No half-assing.

### 1. Make what we want to see in the world
Often this means scratching our own itch—finding problems or fulfilling needs that we have through our own personal experiences and what's inspiring us.

Listening to customers and getting feedback from the marketplace as quickly as possible is essential, but at the end of the day, we should only make things that we want to see in the world. Things we're proud of. Things we want to use. If we can't do that we don't need to be making it, whether or not the market wants us too. We'd rather be smaller and make less money than to put out products that we ourselves wouldn't use. There's no pride in that. That's a fast lane to killing your creativity and sucking the joy out of your life.

### 2. Champion the underdog.
We believe this is an essential element of living a creative life. Big ideas start as tiny, fragile things that can be easily crushed. To do great work, it's essential that we recognize and keep an open mind about our own ideas and the ideas of others, and do whatever we can to highlight others and support them in their creative journey.

We like to be scrappy underdogs, and the underdogs are our people.

### 3. Practice empathy.
Don't confuse empathy with sympathy. Empathy is the secret ingredient in good design, good marketing, great sales people, good customer service, most everything. It's about truly putting yourself in the person you seek to serve's shoes and then serving them.

_Design is how it works_
Empathy is one of the essential elements of good design. Design is how something works just much more than how it looks. Scratching your own itch on something you're designing is a great place to start because you already understand the problem, but it's also really important to talk to your customers and really do the emotional labor of understanding who they are and what they need.

In design they call empathy an "affordance." The way emergency exit doors in a movie theater all can be easily pushed and open to the outside is an empathetic design affordance. If those doors are being used it means there's an emergency, like a fire, and people in that state of mind don't need to waste a second trying to figure out how to open the . A good designer uses their empathy to imagine what it would be like to be in the audience's shoes in that situation and use that empathy to inform their design.

_Empathy is key to marketing_
Empathy is also really useful in marketing because in practicing empathy you are treating the person on the other end . For instance, let's say you've finally had time to write an email to the journalist that might land us some quality press, but it's Friday afternoon on a labor day weekend. The selfish thing to do is to just go ahead and hit send. But the empathetic, and more effective, thing to do is to imagine that that person has probably had a long week like you and is rushing to get out the door to go to the beach with their family for the holiday weekend. The empathic thing to do would be to save the draft of your email and create a to-do for yourself to send it on Tuesday afternoon after they've had a chance to get back into the office and get their head around their own priorities.

_Empathy is how to do customer service_
It's simple. It just means to really put yourself in the customer's shoes and then responding in a way that would feel like a breath of fresh air if you were on the other end of the interaction.

### 4. Don't assume. Experiment & talking to customers.
_Pick your best idea at the time and then talk to customers._
It's our job to come to the best theory about what we should make or do based on the information that we have at the time, and then get something out there as quickly as possible so that we can talk to customers and get real feedback from the market.

The quickest way to find out what people really think is to ask them to pull out their wallet, so the sooner we can get to that point and get real feedback, the better.

There is no room for ego when you take an experimental approach. It also fosters an open mindset that leaves room for new ideas and perspectives. If you're collaborating with someone, this mindset gives their ideas respect without making it personal or about individual tastes.

If you actually measure the results of your theory, there's less room for own  ego to cause blind spots.

This process encourages collaboration and progress that is inclusive of everyone, so it's a core value. Sure, there have been plenty of solo talents that have done great things, but that is not who we are.

### 5. No half-assing
If we decide to do something, we're gonna do it full ass. But! This does not mean we try to do too much, or add too many features, or overdo things to the point that it holds us back. It doesn't mean letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.

What it does mean is learning how to say no. What it means is that if we decide to make a guitar strap we are not going to skimp on any of the materials and we are never going to stop working to improve it.

The true art in doing things well, or full ass, is knowing what to say know to. Naturally, Steve Jobs [said it best](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/629613-people-think-focus-means-saying-yes-to-the-thing-you-ve):

“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”

Either full-ass it, do less, or don't do it at all. This involves a lot of saying no. This requires us to think critically about what we're doing that's wasteful. There's nothing wrong with cutting a product's features in half. Or deciding to cancel something. Or only meeting when you have a specific thing that needs to be discussed in person.

Because when we commit we don't half-ass it. We don't skimp on quality. We take time and pay attention to detail. We're either gonna do it right or we're not going to do it at all. Again, the only way to do this is to say no to almost everything else.

If we find ourselves doing so much that we can't do the important stuff well, then we know we're on the wrong track and we need to cut something out.

This philosophy of saying no and getting rid of waste also applies to physical things and how we do things.

Minimalism doesn't mean nothing for the sake of nothing. It's about whittling down to what matters.
