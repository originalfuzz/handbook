# Our Values

Some things, like showing up to work on time or providing great customer service, are just table stakes that any business needs to be successful. A core value is never table stakes. It's the thing that we'd still do even it was more profitable to do the opposite. It's the thing that gives our brand a personality and gives our company its unique shape. If we had no sharp angles, we'd have nothing for anyone, customers or employees, to latch on to, to care about.

If we have to do business in a way that violates our values, then what's the point of having a business at all? We can all go pursue other things. If we're going to do this, we're going to have our own perspective. This is what we mean by values.

### The Difference Between Tactics and Values
An example of something that is not a core value is practicing lean manufacturing. This is definitely a best practice for modern manufacturing, and we work hard to carry as little inventory as possible, but if it suddenly became a better tactic to carry a ton of inventory we would do it. It's a tactic, not a core value. Our values are the things we won't change even if it hurts us, because, otherwise, why bother?

## Our Values

1. Make we want to see in the world.
2. Practice empathy.
3. Design is how it works.
4. No half-assing.
5. Don't assume. Experiment.

## No half-assing
Either full-ass it, do less, or don't do it at all. This involves a lot of saying no. This requires us to think critically about what we're doing that's wasteful. There's nothing wrong with cutting a product's features in half. Or deciding to cancel. Or only meeting when you . Because when we commit we don't half-ass it. We don't skimp on quality with suppliers. We take time and pay attention to detail. We're either gonna do it right or we're not going to do it. Again, the only way to do this is to say no to a lot of shit.
