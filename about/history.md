# Our History

_It's not just what you do, but how you do it._

Original Fuzz began when Lee McAlilly and Zach Lever met in college and started playing in bands together. They had an idea for a bag they could use to carry around their guitar pedals. In college Zach would always carry his pedals around in a gym bag with a pharmaceutical ad. It was the perfect size for stashing cables and pedals, but everything on the inside was a mess. So, the two friends set out to fix that. That started a never-ending journey of hunting for textiles from around the world and incorporating them into products that fit elegantly into a creative, digital lifestyle.
