# Our Mission

**Our mission is to inspire and aid the creativity of others.**

We believe that unleashing human creativity is the most important factor in securing a better future for our planet. We are in a moment when we must reckon with the environmental crisis, social inequality, and humanity's relationship to technology. Creativity is more valuable and necessary than ever before.

In pursuit of this lofty aim, we hope to develop a great place to work that enables our employees, customers, and partners to do their best work and to make new things. We aim to inspire and teach, and to make products that inspire and aid in the creative process.

_We're not here to just make money. If that's the goal, then we'd all be better off pursuing other things. Original Fuzz should leave the world better than we found it or there's no reason to continue building it._
