# One Goal at a Time
It's important that we are all aligned behind one goal at a time. The origin of the word, priorities, was actually singular, priority. Focusing on too many things is the same as focusing on nothing at all. So we only have one goal for the company at any time. We should always be thinking critically about what we're directing our time, attention, energy, creativity, and money towards. Are we spending our precious resources on reaching our goal?

Staying focused on our goal means saying no to a lot of things. As Steve Jobs, once said, "I'm just as proud of all the things we've said no to as the things we've said yes to."

## Our Current Goal
Our current goal is to grow our website sales to $25,000 per month as quickly as possible.

## Why Did We Choose This Goal?
Longterm we see Original Fuzz as a digital-first brand that has a direct relationship with its customers. Thus, we need to figure out how to build a sustainable business through our website and no other channel. All other sales channels (dealers, events, pop-ups, retail) flow out from this core.

This number of $25,000 per month in website sales is the point where we can break-even with our current team from just website sales alone. Getting to that milestone will give us the runway and breathing room to build even deeper relationships with our dealers, and to grow other channels. It's the foundation from which everything else will flow.

Once we hit this goal, we'll do some self-reflection and figure out where we should go next.
