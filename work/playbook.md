# Playbook

_Be kind to your future self and your co-workers by helping document how we do things in the Playbook. Stay DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. Save it the playbook so we can re-use it later._

Specific things that we need to remember how to do should be saved in the "Playbook". Our playbook is a living document. It will evolve as we grow and change.

There are a lot of specific things that are hard to remember, but that we need to be able to refer back to. This is everything from checklists on how to do something like ship an international wholesale order, to a video on how to sew a guitar strap, to a template for an email we find ourselves frequently writing.

We need everything to pitch in and keep this update as we change how we do things. The goal for this is that a new employee should be able to find everything they need to do their job in the playbook.

If you think you're going to have to repeat yourself. Take a minute to document what you've done for the benefit of others and your future self.

It takes a little longer to stop what you're doing and add detail to the playbook but it saves everyone a lot of time in the long run and helps cut down on errors.
