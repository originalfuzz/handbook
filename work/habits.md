# The Power of Habits
Your life today is really just the sum of your habits. And, the only way to achieve a goal of any kind is to build the habits and routines into your life that will get you there. Want to learn guitar? A great start would be to build 15 minutes into your day for practicing, just like brushing your teeth. In this spirit we have tried to build some habits and rituals into our calendar to ensure we are constantly whittling away at our one goal.
