# Acknowledgement of Employee Handbook

The Original Fuzz Employee Handbook ("Employee Handbook") ​provides​ ​a​ ​framework​ ​for​ ​how​ ​employment, expectations,​ ​advancement,​ ​and​ ​compensation​ ​work​ ​at​ ​Original Fuzz ("the Company"). It contains all the information and links to tools you'll need to hit the ground running.

No​ ​employee​ ​handbook​ ​can​ ​anticipate​ ​every​ ​circumstance​ ​or question​ ​about​ ​policy​ ​and​ ​procedures.​ ​As​ ​Original​ ​Fuzz​ continues to​ ​grow,​ ​the​ ​need​ ​may​ ​arise​ ​and​ ​Original​ ​Fuzz​ ​reserves​ ​the​ right to​ ​change,​ ​add​ ​to​ ​or​ ​delete​ ​any​ ​policies​ ​or​ ​portion​ of​ ​the handbook​ ​from​ ​time-to-time​ ​as​ ​it​ ​deems​ ​appropriate,​ ​in​ its​ ​sole and​ ​absolute​ ​discretion.​ ​Employees​ ​will,​ ​of​ ​course,​ be​ ​notified of​ ​such​ ​changes​ ​to​ ​the​ ​handbook​ ​as​ ​they​ ​occur.

By accepting employment at Original Fuzz, and with confirmation by your signature, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

* I've read, understand and agree to comply with all provisions of the Original Fuzz Employee Handbook which can be found at https://originalfuzz.com/handbook
* I've read and agree to do my best to uphold the company's values and expectations outlined in the Employee Handbook.
* I agree and understand that Employment with the Company is for no specific period of time. Your employment with the Company will be “at will,” meaning that either you or the Company may terminate your employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time to time, the “at will” nature of your employment may only be changed in an express written agreement signed by you and the Company.
