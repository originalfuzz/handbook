# Tools We Use
These are the software tools we use to run our business. A lot of these processes should be detailed in the playbook, but here is a high-level overview of what we use.

## Basecamp
* This is the central hub for everything we do.
* Use Basecamp for all internal communication, not email.
* Refer to the Basecamp project called "Playbook" to see if you can solve your own problem before interrupting others.
* Don't be afraid to assign a co-worker a to-do and give it a date. This is not "bossing them around," rather, it's a clear and concise way to communicate and move projects forward.
* A to-do with no one assigned and no one notified when finished. If it needs to be done by a certain time, it needs a date.

## When I work
* Use this to clock in and view or edit your time sheet.
* This is also where you should share any dates that you are not available or need to request time off.

## Gusto
* Payroll and HR software
* You can login at any time to access payroll history and tax documents
* You'll need to sign your employment agreement to complete your Gusto on-boarding process

## Shopify
* This is where we handle all orders and inventory
* Powers our website
* Note that our products are set up using the "Product Kits" app and there's a particular way we have to update inventory and add new products. This is detailed in the playbook, but ask others before doing this the first time.

## Calendar
* Any calendar dates that other people need to see should go in the Basecamp project called "Original Fuzz HQ." This is different than to-dos that have dates on them. The "Basecamp HQ" calendar is our shared calendar.
* Some people like having a physical calendar as well, but if it goes on the physical calendar you also need to put it into "Original Fuzz HQ" in Basecamp so that everyone on the team can see it any time, any place.

## Email
* Use email for communication with people outside of the company.
* Use Basecamp for internal communication

## Dropbox
* This is like a shared "server"
* We all log in to the hello@originalfuzz.com account treat it like a shared hard-drive.
* Don't add folders at the root and help us keep it organized

## Groove
* Our shared customer support inbox

## Hubspot
* Wholesale CRM and sales task reminders

## Google Docs
* Shared spreadsheets

## Mailchimp
* For sending email newsletters

## Later
* For managing social media posts
