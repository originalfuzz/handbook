# What We Expect From Employees
By accepting employment at Original Fuzz you agree to treat your colleagues and the company the way that you'd like to be treated and abide by these standards.

## Respect for Others
Original​ ​Fuzz​ ​is​ ​committed​ ​to​ ​providing​ ​a​ ​work​ ​environment that​ ​is​ ​free​ ​from​ ​all​ ​forms​ ​of​ ​discrimination​ ​and​ ​conduct that​ ​can​ ​be​ ​considered​ ​harassing,​ ​coercive,​ ​or​ ​disruptive, including​ ​sexual​ ​harassment.​ ​​ ​Actions,​ ​words,​ ​jokes,​ ​or comments​ ​based​ ​on​ ​an​ ​individual's​ ​sex,​ ​race,​ ​color, national​ ​origin,​ ​age,​ ​religion,​ ​disability,​ ​sexual orientation,​ ​or​ ​any​ ​other​ ​legally​ ​protected​ ​characteristic will​ ​not​ ​be​ ​tolerated.

## Assignment of work
Companies​ ​like​ ​Original​ ​Fuzz​ ​that​ ​design​ ​and​ ​produce​ ​a myriad​ ​of​ ​products​ ​must​ ​protect​ ​their​ ​work​ ​product.​ ​It​ ​is the​ ​essence​ ​of​ ​the​ ​company.​ ​Any​ ​work​ ​product​ ​produced​ ​by​ ​an employee​ ​on​ ​behalf​ ​of​ ​the​ ​company​ ​while​ ​employed​ ​by​ ​the company​ ​belongs​ ​to​ ​the​ ​company.​ ​This​ ​includes,​ ​but​ ​is​ ​not limited​ ​to,​ ​things​ ​like​ ​blog​ ​posts,​ ​artwork,​ ​photography, graphic​ ​design,​ ​product​ ​designs,​ ​and​ ​prototypes,​ ​etc.

## Non-compete Agreement
During an employee's time at the company and in​ ​the​ ​event​ ​that​ ​an​ ​employee​ ​leaves​ ​the​ ​company,​ employees agree​ ​that​ ​they​ ​won't​ ​directly​ ​compete​ ​with​ ​Original​ ​Fuzz by​ working in any capacity to sell or develop ​similar​ ​products​ ​either​ ​personally​ ​or​ ​on​ ​behalf of​ ​another​ ​company​ ​or​ ​competitor. ​Employees​ ​understand​ ​that they​ ​will​ ​be​ ​learning​ ​trade​ ​secrets,​ ​meeting​ ​key​ ​suppliers, learning​ ​internal​ ​processes,​ ​and​ ​more​ ​during​ ​their​ ​time​ ​at the​ ​company,​ ​and​ ​they​ ​agree​ ​not​ ​to​ use​ ​this​ ​knowledge against​ ​the​ ​company's​ ​interests​ ​for​ ​at​ ​least​ ​one​ ​year. Employees​ ​also​ ​acknowledge​ ​that​ ​this​ ​is​ ​a​ ​fair​ ​and​ ​standard agreement​ ​in​ ​any​ ​employer/employee​ ​relationship.

## Good Habits
* Meetings are not your friend. In general meetings are a big waste of time, so only schedule them when their really needed and only include the people that really need to be there. Don't ever create a periodic standing meeting that just repeats on your calendar.
* Inventory is not a good thing. We need to be as lean as we possibly can.
* When​ ​we​ ​notice​ ​something​ ​that​ ​could​ ​be​ ​better​ ​we​ ​take action​ ​to​ ​fix​ ​it.​ ​Even​ ​if​ ​that​ ​is​ ​just​ ​logging​ ​it​ ​in Basecamp​ ​to​ ​be​ ​addressed​ ​later.
* We​ ​have​ ​a​ ​good​ ​attitude.​ ​We​ ​collaborate​ ​with​ ​others,​ ​and​ ​we aren't​ ​afraid​ ​to​ ​have​ ​a​ ​dissenting​ ​opinion​ ​that​ ​we​ ​share​ ​in a​ ​way​ ​that's​ ​respectful​ ​to​ ​everyone​ ​else.
* We​ ​all​ ​participate​ ​in​ ​the​ ​marketing​ ​at​ ​the​ ​company—we​ ​help write​ ​blog​ ​posts,​ ​make​ ​video​ ​content,​ ​record​ ​podcasts,​ ​take photographs,​ ​make​ ​artwork,​ ​etc.
* We​ ​are​ ​good​ ​stewards​ ​of​ ​spending​ ​and​ ​our​ ​budget.
* We​ ​all​ ​understand​ ​that​ ​customer​ ​service​ ​is​ ​a​ ​team​ ​effort and​ ​is​ ​a​ ​part​ ​of​ ​everyone's​ ​job.
* We​ ​are​ ​proactive​ ​and​ ​self-reliant.​ ​It’s​ ​better​ ​to​ ​ask​ ​for forgiveness​ ​than​ ​permission.
* We​ ​all​ ​help​ ​measure​ ​and​ ​track​ ​performance​ ​metrics—weekly sales​ ​goals,​ ​inventory​ ​levels,​ ​production​ ​output,​ ​etc.

## Good Housekeeping
* Please​ ​show​ ​up​ ​on​ ​time​ ​and​ ​give​ ​it​ ​your​ ​best.
* Please​ ​give​ ​us​ ​a​ ​couple​ ​weeks​ ​notice​ ​if​ ​you​ ​need​ ​to​ ​take vacation​ ​or​ ​a​ ​personal​ ​day.​ ​Be​ ​sure​ ​to​ ​list​ ​it​ ​on​ ​the shared​ ​calendar​ ​in​ ​basecamp​ ​and​ ​notify​ ​everyone.​ ​If​ ​you're sick,​ ​do​ ​us​ ​the​ ​courtesy​ ​of​ ​calling​ ​in​ ​before​ ​your​ ​shift starts.
* Please​ ​clock​ ​in​ ​and​ ​out​ ​of​ ​your​ ​timesheet​ ​in​ ​real​ ​time while​ ​on​ ​your​ ​shift. You are responsible for the accuracy of your timesheet.
* Use secure passwords. Sign up for services for the company with our shared email address, hello@originalfuzz.com, and use a secure password that you save in 1Password. If you can remember the password it's not secure. You should use a different password on every website that you sign up for. Not only is good digital hygiene for your personal life, it's absolutely essential that we do this in order to protect, not just the company's financial information, assets and data, but that of our customers.
* Please​ ​help​ ​keep​ ​our​ ​inventory​ ​levels​ ​accurate​ ​and​ stay on top of our production priorities.
* Please​ ​help​ ​us​ ​keep​ ​our​ ​shared​ ​workspace​ ​clean and recycle.​ ​Everyone pitches​ ​in​ ​on​ ​vacuuming,​ ​taking​ ​out​ ​the​ ​trash,​ ​etc.
* Take a break. If you are working a full day, or more than a four-hour shift, please clock out and take a lunch break. Don't eat at your job. Not only is this a good idea, it's the law. Also, natural short breaks during shifts are encouraged within reason. Use your judgment and treat the company's resources how you would like to be treated. No need to clock out for these types of shorter breaks.

## Performance Reviews
* Periodically​ ​we​ ​ask​ ​every​ ​employee​ ​to​ ​take​ ​a​ ​brief​ ​survey to​ ​give​ ​us​ ​feedback​ ​on​ ​how​ ​they're​ ​doing,​ ​what​ ​we​ ​can improve,​ ​etc.​ ​Then​ ​we'll​ ​follow​ ​this​ ​up​ ​with​ ​a​ ​meeting between​ ​managers​ ​and​ ​employees​ ​about​ ​job​ ​performance, things​ ​we'd​ ​like​ ​to​ ​improve​ ​about​ ​how​ ​we​ ​can​ ​work​ ​and collaborate​ ​better.
* The​ ​feedback​ ​and​ ​review​ ​process​ ​is​ ​a​ ​two-way​ ​street​ ​and feedback​ ​should​ ​go​ ​both​ ​ways​ ​from​ ​manager​ ​to​ ​employee​ ​and vice​ ​versa.

## Pay Periods
* We have 2 pay periods each month and employees are paid on the 1st and 15th of every month. For instance, on June 1, you'll be paid for work done between May 1 and May 15. Then on June 15, you'll be paid for work done between May 16 and 31.
* Note that when you first start, there will be a two-week lag because you have to wait for the current pay period to end and then you'll be paid on the next payroll after that.

## Direct Deposit, Taxes & HR Documents
* When you first start working we'll set you up with a Gusto account. This is your account and we don't have access to your private bank information. So you'll need to complete the Gusto on-boarding to set up your account and direct deposit.
* Our HR software, Gusto, will send you any tax documents you need at the beginning of every year. These will be sent to the personal email address that you have set up in your Gusto account.
* If at any point in time you need access to tax documents or your payroll history, you can login to Gusto.com using your email address. If you've forgotten your password, just request a password reset.
* If you need to change your bank account for direct deposit you can log in and do that at any time.
* When setting up your Gusto account we'll need you to sign your employment agreement as a part of the on-boarding process.
